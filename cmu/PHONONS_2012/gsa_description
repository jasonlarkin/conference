This is my accepted talk abstract:

Ordered and Disordered Contributions to Lattice Thermal Conductivity

Understanding thermal transport in crystalline systems requires detailed
knowledge of phonons, which
are the quanta of energy associated with atomic vibrations. By definition,
phonons are non-localized
vibrations that transport energy over distances much larger than the atomic
spacing. For disordered materials (e.g., alloys, amorphous phases), with the
exception of very long wavelength modes, the vibrational modes are localized
and do not propagate like phonons. The Einstein model assumes that the mean
free path of these localized vibrations is the average interatomic distance
and that their group velocity is equal to the speed of sound. The
Cahill-Pohl model assumes that the mean free path of the localized modes is
equal to half of their wavelength. While these approach can be used to
estimate a lower limit to the thermal conductivity of disordered systems,
they only provide a
qualitative description of the vibrations that contribute to the lattice
thermal conductivity.

Using lattice dynamics calculations and molecular dynamics simulations on
Lennard-Jones crystalline, alloy, and amorphous systems, we predict and
characterize the contributions from phonons and localized vibrations to
lattice thermal conductivity. The results are used to motivate simple and
computationally cheap models to predict the lattice thermal conductivity of
a range of disordered materials.


This conference provides a unique oppurtunity to meet with other researchers on the topic of phonons (as per the conference title).  In particular, researchers working on a wide range of phonon topics will be in attendance, ranging from the nano-scale (which I work on) to the meso- and macro-scales.  For this reason I believe this conference will be a very useful interaction with topics I do not normally get exposed to.
