Dear Jason Larkin,

The PHONONS 2012 Program Committee is pleased to inform you that your paper (64 - Ordered and Disordered Contributions to Lattice Thermal Conductivity) has been accepted for oral presentation at PHONONS 2012. Please note the following important information:

1. Contributed oral presentations are scheduled for 12 minutes + 3 minutes of questions. The detailed schedule for PHONONS 2012 (July 8-12, 2012) will be posted during the next week at www.phonons2012.com.

2. In your author console at https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/PHONONS2012/ you will now be able to submit a camera-ready version of your abstract. This allows us to verify that all of your information will be correct in printed and online conference materials. Please follow the instructions at your author console and submit this version by April 9, 2012. If you already entered everything correctly when you originally submitted your abstract, and you correctly used the PHONONS 2012 docx template, then this process should not take more than a few minutes.

3. Online registration is now open - see directions at www.phonons2012.com. You can save $75 by registering before May 2.

4. Visa invitation letters can also be requested now from your author console (https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/PHONONS2012/). Requests will be approved within 24 hours, allowing you to download an auto-generated visa letter in docx format. If you require letterhead at the top of the letter, please save the auto-generated docx file (which will contain all of your contact info) and email it to phonons2012@umich.edu. A version with letterhead will be emailed back to you within 24 hours.

Thanks again for supporting PHONONS - we look forward to seeing you this July in Ann Arbor!
